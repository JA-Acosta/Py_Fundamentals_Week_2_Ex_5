This is the eleventh program derived from 100 program prompts suggested by ChatGPT for a 4 week python course. My main goal is to pay close attention to pythonic syntax, creating/updating git repositories, and developing good commenting habits. Upon completing this program, I'll push it to github and request feedback from my peers.

Prompt used:
